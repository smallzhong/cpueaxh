`Cpueaxh` is a lightweight, fully dependency-free `x86-64` CPU emulation library with innovative support for emulating execution directly inside the current process memory space.

***This project is under active development. It currently supports common x64 instructions, SSE, SSE2, AVX, AVX2, and a small subset of other instruction sets. The goal is to eventually support the full x86-64 instruction set, including Heaven's Gate transitions. Stay tuned, and issues and contributions are very welcome.***

The project is designed to provide:
- a core execution engine that can be embedded directly in user-mode or kernel/driver-side projects.
- a pure `C ABI` public interface.
- an API style that is as close as practical to [Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn).
- both a [Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn)-like self-managed memory mode **(guest mode)** and direct emulation in real memory space **(host mode)**.
- host-mode memory patching, allowing the emulated CPU to observe bytes different from the underlying real memory.
- a single core codebase that can be built for user mode or compiled directly into a kernel driver through a small platform abstraction layer, without maintaining two copies of the emulator core.
- the library does not depend on exception handling for execution.

## Highlights

### 1. Pure C ABI
The public header is [cpueaxh/cpueaxh.hpp](cpueaxh/cpueaxh.hpp).

All exported APIs use the `cpueaxh_*` naming convention and can be called directly from both C and C++.

### 2. Static library form
The core project [cpueaxh/cpueaxh.vcxproj](cpueaxh/cpueaxh.vcxproj) builds as a static library, making integration straightforward.

### 3. Two memory modes
- `CPUEAXH_MEMORY_MODE_GUEST`
  - memory must be mapped explicitly by the user.
  - usage is intentionally close to Unicorn.
- `CPUEAXH_MEMORY_MODE_HOST`
  - emulation runs against the current process address space.
  - supports patch overlays so the CPU can see patched bytes without modifying the underlying real memory.
  - useful for host tracing, live function analysis, and instrumentation.

### 4. Status-based CPU exceptions
Exception state is stored in the CPU context and can be queried through:
- `cpueaxh_code_exception()`
- `cpueaxh_error_code_exception()`

Currently modeled exception types include:
- `#DE`
- `#GP`
- `#SS`
- `#NP`
- `#UD`
- `#PF`
- `#AC`

### 5. Unicorn-like memory management semantics
Guest-mode memory management supports:
- `cpueaxh_mem_map()`
- `cpueaxh_mem_map_ptr()`
- `cpueaxh_mem_unmap()`
- `cpueaxh_mem_protect()`
- `cpueaxh_mem_regions()`

The current implementation includes:
- 4 KB page alignment checks
- range-splitting `unmap` and `protect`
- mapped region enumeration
- separate `READ/WRITE/FETCH_UNMAPPED` results
- separate `READ/WRITE/FETCH_PROT` results

### 6. CPU-level memory attributes
In addition to normal `R/W/X` page permissions, the engine supports CPU-visible page attributes:
- `cpueaxh_mem_set_cpu_attrs()`
- `CPUEAXH_MEM_ATTR_USER`

This allows the emulator to raise proper page faults when CPL and page attributes do not match, rather than degrading to a generic access failure.

### 7. Hooking and escape mechanism
The engine supports basic code hooks, Unicorn-like memory access hooks, and instruction escape handling:
- `cpueaxh_hook_add()` / `cpueaxh_hook_del()`
- `cpueaxh_hook_add_address()` for exact-address hooks
- `CPUEAXH_HOOK_CODE_PRE` and `CPUEAXH_HOOK_CODE_POST`
- `CPUEAXH_HOOK_MEM_READ`, `CPUEAXH_HOOK_MEM_WRITE`, and `CPUEAXH_HOOK_MEM_FETCH`
- `CPUEAXH_HOOK_MEM_READ_UNMAPPED`, `CPUEAXH_HOOK_MEM_WRITE_UNMAPPED`, and `CPUEAXH_HOOK_MEM_FETCH_UNMAPPED`
- `CPUEAXH_HOOK_MEM_READ_PROT`, `CPUEAXH_HOOK_MEM_WRITE_PROT`, and `CPUEAXH_HOOK_MEM_FETCH_PROT`
- `cpueaxh_escape_add()` / `cpueaxh_escape_del()`
- `cpueaxh_host_call()` for bridging an escape into native execution

Memory-access hooks are range-filterable and follow Unicorn-style split semantics. Successful accesses use `cpueaxh_cb_hookmem_t` and report instruction fetches, memory reads, and memory writes together with address, access size, and value. Invalid accesses use `cpueaxh_cb_hookmem_invalid_t`; the callback may fix the mapping/protection state and return nonzero to retry the access, or return `0` to let emulation fail with the corresponding memory error. For invalid reads and fetches the reported value is `0`, while invalid writes report the attempted write value.

An escape is intended for handing selected instructions off from the emulator to a real host-side execution path.
The escape callback receives the decoded instruction bytes together with a mutable `cpueaxh_x86_context`, and may either emulate the instruction manually in `C/C++` or transfer execution through `cpueaxh_host_call()`.
When `cpueaxh_host_call()` is used, the library applies the emulated register, flag, and SIMD state to the real CPU context, jumps into the user-provided native bridge routine, and then captures the resulting machine state back into the emulator context.
In the native bridge routine, the top of the guest stack is prepared with a resume target, so the routine can jump back through the address stored at `[rsp]` when native handling is complete.
This makes escape callbacks suitable both for handwritten `asm` bridges and for higher-level software emulation logic.
The current example project demonstrates both styles: native `asm` bridges for `syscall`, `cpuid`, and `xgetbv`, and direct `C/C++` emulation for instructions such as `rdtsc`, `rdtscp`, and `rdrand`.

The escape mechanism currently supports dispatch for these instruction classes:
- `syscall`, `sysenter`
- `int`, `int3`, `hlt`
- `cpuid`, `xgetbv`, `rdtsc`, `rdtscp`, `rdrand`
- port I/O instructions `in` and `out`

Escape callbacks are registered per instruction class, can be constrained to an address range, and the current implementation allows one registered escape per instruction class.

### 8. Full public x86 context structure
The public `cpueaxh_x86_context` includes:
- GPRs
- `RIP`
- `RFLAGS`
- `XMM` and upper `YMM` state
- `MMX`
- `MXCSR`
- segment registers
- `GDTR/LDTR`
- `CPL`
- current exception state

This is useful for host mode, escape callbacks, debugging, and state synchronization.

cpueaxh_err err = cpueaxh_open(CPUEAXH_ARCH_X86, CPUEAXH_MODE_64, &engine);
```

cpueaxh_set_memory_mode(engine, CPUEAXH_MEMORY_MODE_GUEST);
cpueaxh_mem_map(engine, 0x1000, 0x1000, CPUEAXH_PROT_READ | CPUEAXH_PROT_WRITE | CPUEAXH_PROT_EXEC);
cpueaxh_mem_write(engine, 0x1000, code, code_size);
```

### 3. Set registers and start execution

cpueaxh_emu_start(engine, 0x1000, 0, 0, 0);
```

### 4. Query mapped regions

cpueaxh_mem_region* regions = NULL;
uint32_t count = 0;
if (cpueaxh_mem_regions(engine, &regions, &count) == CPUEAXH_ERR_OK) {
    cpueaxh_free(regions);
}
```

## Example program

The example is located in [example/main.cpp](example/main.cpp) and includes:
- a basic guest-mode execution demo
- a guest pre-hook demo that prints the current address and the next 16 bytes
- a guest post-hook demo that prints the post-instruction `RIP`
- a guest exact-address hook demo
- a guest memory-access hook demo for fetch/read/write events
- a guest invalid-memory recovery demo for `READ_UNMAPPED` and `WRITE_PROT`
- a host-mode `MessageBoxA` execution demo
- a host-mode memory patch demo
- default escape handlers covering `syscall`, `sysenter`, `int`, `int3`, `cpuid`, `xgetbv`, `rdtsc`, `rdtscp`, `rdrand`, `hlt`, `in`, and `out`

The example project currently has no external library dependency beyond the Windows / MSVC toolchain and uses MASM for the native escape bridge samples.

The kernel sample is located in [kexample/main.cpp](kexample/main.cpp). It demonstrates host-mode execution inside a KMDF non-PnP driver and links against the kernel-mode static library [kcpueaxh](kcpueaxh), so the emulator implementation remains shared between user mode and kernel mode.

## Build

Recommended environment:
- Windows
- Visual Studio 2022
- MSVC v143
- x64
- WDK / KMDF if you want to build [kexample](kexample)

## Current project position

This project currently fits best as a:
- research-oriented or experimental `x86-64` emulator
- Windows host analysis and instrumentation core
- lightweight execution engine with Unicorn-like API design

It is not a complete Unicorn replacement and not a full system virtualization solution, but it already provides substantial user-mode execution, memory permission control, exception modeling, and host escape capabilities.
